## API Documentation
The API stores information about all the plants one would want in their vegetable and herb gardens. Depth to plant, space needed to grow, time to harvest, type of soil needed, type of climate needed, indoors and/or outdoors, potted or ground safe, how much to water, and sunlight needed. All these factors can be slightly overwhelming at first. To help with this we've combined all these into one 'Difficulty' score. With this, you can start small and work your way up to garden glory.
